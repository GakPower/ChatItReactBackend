## ChatItBackEnd
ChatItBackEnd is the backend code for a website where you can login and chat in a public group room.
Everything from the authentication system, password recovery and the main chat of the application are build from scratch.

This repository is the backend part of a full-stack project which means that it is just **half** of the project. Click [here](https://github.com/GakPower/ChatItReactBackend) to check the frontend code.
